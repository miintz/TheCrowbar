A Girl by Ezra Pound					|		An Oak by Ezra Pound
							|
The tree has entered my hands, 				|		The tree has entered my hands,
The sap has ascended my arms, 				|		The sap has ascended my arms, 
The tree has grown in my breast- 			|		The tree has grown in my breast-
Downward, 						|		Downward,
The branches grow out of me, like arms. 		|		The branches grow out of me, like arms.
							|
Tree you are, 						|		Tree you are, 
Moss you are, 						|		Moss you are, 
You are violets with wind above them. 			|		You are violets with wind above them.
A child - so high - you are, 				|		A child - so high - you are,
And all this is folly to the world.			|		And all this is folly to the world.
