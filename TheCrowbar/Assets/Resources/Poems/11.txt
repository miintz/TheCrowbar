A Poison Tree by William Blake							|		A Poison Tree by William Blake
										|
I was angry with my friend;							|		I was angry with my friend;
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.						|		I told my love, my love did end.
I was angry with my foe:							|		I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.						|		I told it not, my love did grow.
										|
And I waterd it in fears,							|		And I waterd it in fears,	
Night & morning with my tears:							|		Night & morning with my tears:
And I sunned it with smiles,							|		And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.							|		And with soft deceitful wiles.
										|	
And it grew both day and night,							|		And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.							|		Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,							|		And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.							|		And he knew that it was mine.
										|
And into my garden stole.							|		And into my garden stole.
When the night had veiled the pole;						|		When the night had veiled the pole;
In the morning glad I see,							|		In the morning glad I see,
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.						|		My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.
